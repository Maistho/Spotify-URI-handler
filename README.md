Spotify-URI-handler
===================

A simple chrome extension that redirects all requests to open.spotify.com to local URIs (spotify:track:whatever)
Works half-bad with external links, since it doesn't close the new tab created.

To build, enable developer mode in chrome and package the extension with chrome. Then drop the .crx file in chrome.
